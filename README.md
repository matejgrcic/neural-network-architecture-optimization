# Neural Network Architecture Optimization

## Overview
This project implements an algorithm for evolving architecture of artificial neural networks. Genetic algorithms are used for evolving network's architecture. The direct coding scheme is used for representing networks architecture in each individual. The neural network is trained using PSO algorithm.
